# libgdx-kotlin-template-gsk

This is a template for LibGDX using Kotlin,  and [gradle-script-kotlin](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-script-kotlin). It also has [KTX](https://github.com/libktx/ktx) dependencies. It currently only has the core and desktop modules. 

I created this because the official LibGDX project generator is still using an old version of gradle and old tasks, I didn't like the project structure it made, it didn't automatically add Kotlin support, and it was using the Groovy Gradle DSL, and I prefer the new Kotlin Gradle DSL.

To use it, simply download the repo and import it as a Gradle project in IntelliJ using settings.gradle
